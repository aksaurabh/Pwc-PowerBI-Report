# HR Analytics - Diversity and Inclusivity

Here, we create a dashboard on employee participation in the organization. We define the key KPIs like New Hires, Promotions, Employee Exits, and Employee Gender ratio to understand the situation of diversity and inclusivity in the workforce. Enabling diversity and eliminating gender-based stereotyping is key to a balanced workforce and company success.


Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

number of men

number of women

number of leavers

% employees promoted (FY21)

% of women promoted

% of hires men

% of hires women

% turnover

Average performance rating: men

Average Performance rating: women
